# Reporting Security Issues

The CrossWind Technologies team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security concerns, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions promptly.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory [“Report a Vulnerability”](https://github.com/crosswindtech/.github/security/advisories/new) tab.

The CrossWind Technologies team will respond with the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a resolution and may ask for additional information or guidance if necessary.

If you discover a security vulnerability in third-party modules we use, please report it to the maintainers of those modules.
